# pluto

**P**owerful **L**ocator for **U**nifying **T**ransparent **O**bjects

This acronym reflects the ability of a DI manager to serve as a powerful tool for locating and unifying various
transparent objects (dependencies) within a software application. It highlights the role of the DI manager in seamlessly
bringing together components and resources to enhance the modularity and maintainability of the application.

# `npm install endpoint-pluto`

```js
var deps = require("endpoint-pluto")()

let registerDependancy = deps.bind

const murmur = {}
registerDependancy("murmur").toInstance(murmur);






```

The pattern you're describing is known as "Dependency Injection" (DI). Dependency Injection is a design pattern that
promotes the separation of concerns by allowing components to depend on abstractions instead of concrete
implementations. It's a way to provide objects with their dependencies instead of creating them within the object
itself.

In the context of your `pluto` module, you are building an IoC (Inversion of Control) container, which is a common
approach to implementing the Dependency Injection pattern.

Here's how you can use the `pluto` IoC container for dependency injection:

1. **Create the IoC Container:**
   Instantiate the `pluto` container to manage your application's dependencies.
   ```javascript
   const pluto = require('pluto');
   const depMan = pluto();
   ```

2. **Bind Dependencies:**
   Use the `bind` method to define bindings between names and dependencies.
   ```javascript
   depMan.bind('userService').toInstance(new UserService());
   depMan.bind('logger').toFactory(() => new Logger());
   depMan.bind('database').toConstructor(DatabaseConnection);
   ```

3. **Resolve Dependencies:**
   Use the `get` method to resolve and retrieve dependencies.
   ```javascript
   const userService = depMan.get('userService');
   const logger = depMan.get('logger');
   const db = await depMan.get('database');
   ```

Here are some naming suggestions that could make your code even more understandable:

1. **Container Factory:**
   ```javascript
   const dependencyContainer = require('pluto')(); // Create the dependency container
   ```

2. **Service Bindings:**
   ```javascript
   dependencyContainer.bind('userService').toInstance(new UserService());
   dependencyContainer.bind('loggerService').toFactory(() => new Logger());
   dependencyContainer.bind('databaseService').toConstructor(DatabaseConnection);
   ```

3. **Dependency Resolution:**
   ```javascript
   const userService = dependencyContainer.get('userService');
   const loggerService = dependencyContainer.get('loggerService');
   const databaseService = await dependencyContainer.get('databaseService');
   ```

4. **Bootstrap:**
   ```javascript
   const appServices = await dependencyContainer.bootstrap();
   ```

5. **Advanced Usage:**
   If you want to provide additional control over your application's configuration, you can use features
   like `toConstructor` to bind classes, `getAll` to resolve multiple dependencies, and more.

Remember that clear and meaningful names are essential for making your code readable and maintainable. Choose names that
reflect the role and purpose of each dependency in your application.

Certainly, here are 10 different names for the `dependencyContainer`, along with arguments for why each name could be
used from various points of view:

1. **`serviceRegistry`**
    - **Point of View:** Organizing and registering services.
    - **Argument:** This name reflects that the container acts as a central registry for services, making it easy to
      manage and access them throughout the application.

2. **`appInjector`**
    - **Point of View:** Injecting dependencies into the application.
    - **Argument:** The name emphasizes that the container is responsible for injecting the required dependencies into
      various parts of the application.

3. **`componentManager`**
    - **Point of View:** Managing components and their interactions.
    - **Argument:** This name suggests that the container handles the management and resolution of components, promoting
      a modular and organized architecture.

4. **`contextContainer`**
    - **Point of View:** Providing a contextual environment for dependencies.
    - **Argument:** The name implies that the container holds a context that encapsulates the application's
      dependencies, offering a clear separation of concerns.

5. **`resourceFactory`**
    - **Point of View:** Creating and providing resources.
    - **Argument:** This name indicates that the container is responsible for creating and supplying the required
      resources (dependencies) for the application.

6. **`diManager`**
    - **Point of View:** Managing dependency injection.
    - **Argument:** The name reflects the primary purpose of the containerâ€”to manage and facilitate the dependency
      injection process.

7. **`moduleConnector`**
    - **Point of View:** Connecting and integrating application modules.
    - **Argument:** This name suggests that the container acts as a connector, bringing different modules of the
      application together by managing their dependencies.

8. **`interfaceHub`**
    - **Point of View:** Providing a hub for interface implementations.
    - **Argument:** The name implies that the container serves as a hub for resolving and supplying various interface
      implementations needed in the application.

9. **`aspectResolver`**
    - **Point of View:** Resolving cross-cutting concerns and aspects.
    - **Argument:** This name suggests that the container handles the resolution of aspects or cross-cutting concerns,
      making the application more modular and maintainable.

10. **`dependencyVault`**
    - **Point of View:** Safeguarding and providing dependencies.
    - **Argument:** The name implies that the container securely holds and provides the necessary dependencies,
      emphasizing their importance to the application's functionality.

Each of these names highlights a different aspect of the container's role and functionality. The choice of name depends
on the perspective that best aligns with your application's architecture and development philosophy.

Constructing an application using Inversion of Control (IoC) principles involves designing your application to have
loosely coupled components where dependencies are provided externally rather than being created internally. This
promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability. Here's an overview of how to construct an app using IoC
principles:

1. **Define Dependencies:**
   Identify the various components and services your application requires. Define interfaces for these components to
   abstract their implementations.

2. **Create an IoC Container:**
   Use an IoC container framework (or build your own) to manage dependencies and their lifecycles. The IoC container is
   responsible for instantiating and providing dependencies as needed.

3. **Bind Dependencies:**
   Configure the IoC container to associate interfaces with their concrete implementations. This is typically done
   through binding in the container.

4. **Inject Dependencies:**
   In your application's components, use constructor injection, property injection, or method injection to receive
   dependencies from the IoC container.

5. **Global Container or Hierarchical Containers:**
   You can maintain a single global container or use hierarchical containers for different parts of your application.
   Hierarchical containers allow different sections of your app to have their own isolated containers.

6. **Managing Lifecycles:**
   The IoC container can manage the lifecycle of objects, creating them when needed and ensuring they are properly
   disposed of when no longer needed.

7. **Promoting Decoupling:**
   By using interfaces and dependency injection, you're decoupling components from their concrete implementations. This
   makes it easier to replace implementations and switch out parts of your application.

8. **Testing and Mocking:**
   IoC makes unit testing easier as you can inject mock objects for testing. This isolation ensures that tests focus on
   individual components.

9. **Scalability and Maintainability:**
   IoC promotes modular design, which aids in scaling your application and maintaining different parts independently.

Regarding leveraging IoC principles in a worker function to maintain state across requests, here's an approach:

1. **Singleton State Management:**
   Use a singleton object managed by the IoC container to hold the shared state. This singleton can be injected into
   worker functions.

2. **Dependency Injection in Workers:**
   When a worker function is invoked, inject the shared state singleton into the function. This allows workers to access
   and modify the shared state.

3. **State Isolation and Concurrency:**
   Ensure that the shared state is thread-safe and can handle concurrent access. IoC containers often handle thread
   safety when managing singleton instances.

4. **Dependency Scoping:**
   Depending on your use case, you might want to consider scoping the lifetime of the shared state instance based on
   request or session boundaries.

5. **Avoid Global State Pitfalls:**
   While sharing state can be helpful, be cautious not to overuse global state as it can make your application harder to
   reason about and maintain.

Remember that while IoC can provide many benefits, it's important to strike a balance and apply it where it's
appropriate in your application's architecture.
